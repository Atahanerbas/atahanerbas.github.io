# Logic and Philosophy

## Who am I? 
Atahan. I am interested in everything related to logic or philosophy (inclusive disjunction). I share my life with a cat, her name is Nacho Beybi. 

## Who am I officially?
Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Philosophy at KU Leuven under the supervision of Lorenz Demey and Stef Frijters. My PhD project is titled the philosophy of logical geometry. I draw Aristotelian diagrams. Below, everything starting with 'P-' is PhD related and the others are not.
